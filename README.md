Company Bankruptcy PredictionThis repository contains code and data for predicting company bankruptcies. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy based on various financial and non-financial features.

DatasetThe dataset used for this project is stored in the data directory. It consists of a CSV file named bankruptcy_data.csv, which contains the following columns:

Company ID: A unique identifier for each company.
Feature 1 to Feature n: Various financial and non-financial features that are potentially relevant for predicting bankruptcy.
Bankrupt: A binary label indicating whether the company went bankrupt (1) or not (0).
Please note that the dataset provided here is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect real-world data. It is highly recommended to use real financial datasets for accurate bankruptcy predictions.

CodeThe code for training and evaluating the bankruptcy prediction model is available in the code directory. The main script is bankruptcy_prediction.py, which performs the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Reads the dataset, performs any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Provides an interface to predict bankruptcy for new, unseen data.
