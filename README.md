# Company Bankruptcy Prediction Project
This repository contains code and resources for the Company Bankruptcy Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify companies at risk of bankruptcy.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the "data" directory. It includes financial and non-financial features of various companies. The target variable is the bankruptcy status (1 if bankrupt, 0 if not bankrupt).

Code
The "code" directory contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. The code is well-documented and organized for easy understanding and reproducibility.

Models
The trained models are stored in the "models" directory. These models can be used for making predictions on new data. Instructions on how to load and use the models are provided in the documentation.

Results
The "results" directory contains evaluation metrics, visualizations, and summary reports of the model performance. It provides insights into the accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics achieved by the models.

Usage
To use this project, follow the instructions in the documentation to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions. Make sure to install the required dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
